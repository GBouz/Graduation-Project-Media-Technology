### Data collection application

In this repo there is the Processing Application that was used to collect the data. It utilizes Kinect v2, and it is used to host interactive sessions with users. The session is supposed to flow in the following steps:

1. The participant holds his extended finger still, while looking at a feedback screen with a lock drawing.
2. When the lock disappears, the participant makes the drawing.
3. To close the drawing the participant holds his finger still again, until a green light flickers and the drawing re-appears.
4. The user relaxes his hand and starts again.
